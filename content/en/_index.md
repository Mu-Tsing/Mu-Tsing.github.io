Hi, I am Mu-Tsing (慕青), a first year Ph.D. student at CUHK, Shenzhen campus. I am interested in general mathematics and compute science.

## Website Features Update
- [ ] Image Embeding Support. 2025-04-11

- [x] Math Equation Support. 2025-04-10

  Now, I can use KaTex to write math equation:

  $$
    S_1 \rhd S_2 \rhd ... \rhd S_n
  $$



- [x] pdf files embedded. 2025-04-10
  
  The pdf files are embedded by [hugo-embed-pdf-shortcode](https://github.com/anvithks/hugo-embed-pdf-shortcode), which use the relative path to include a pdf file. It is conflict with the tags function. 

  The one need to include the file in the content folder manually.
